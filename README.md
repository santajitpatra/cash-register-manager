# Cash Register Manager Web App

Welcome to the Cash Register Manager web app! This app allows you to manage your cash register by calculating the change to be returned to customers after a purchase.

Then, open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to start using the app.

## Usage

To use the Cash Register Manager web app, follow these steps:

1. Enter the total amount due and the amount paid by the customer in the input fields.
2. Click the "Calculate Change" button to calculate the change to be returned to the customer.
3. The app will display the total change due and the breakdown of each type of bill/coin that should be returned to the customer.

## How it Works

The Cash Register Manager web app uses a simple algorithm to calculate the change to be returned to the customer. It takes the total amount due and the amount paid by the customer as inputs, and then calculates the difference between the two. It then breaks down this difference into the minimum number of bills and coins needed to return the exact change due.
